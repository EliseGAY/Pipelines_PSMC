# Run PSMC with bootstrap

#===========================================#

# Aim : 
#------#
Run PSMC with bootstrap on BAM files

# Input :
#----------#
BAM file (zipped or not)

# Methods :
#----------#
Use PSMC tool by applying the pipeline provides by the authors : https://github.com/lh3/psmc
This pipeline here is made to provide usable scripts to run psmc on the cluster (adatped for PSL cluster with SLURM command)

How to run the script on the cluster : 
	sh step1_create_psmcfa.sh
	sh step2_bootstrap_psmc.sh
	sh step3_combined_plot_psmc.sh

note that the "sbatch script.sh" command to run one slurm script on each individuals is comprised inside the script "psmc.sh" itself (line 70)

# Details :
#----------#

Run 3 scripts.
# STEP 1 : 
	step1_create_psmcfa.sh :  variant calling and split consensus sequences
	- Variant calling with BCFTOOLS (not GATK)
	- (Optional) Chose only first scaffold / chromosome as you please.
	- fq2psmcfa : create a consensus sequence
		
	If you want to  change the bin size, use the -s paramters as follow
		fq2psmcfa -s 40 XXX.consensus.fq.gz > XXX.consensus.psmcfa
		!!! Carefull : if you change the bin size (default = 100), you have to re-scale the N size in the PSMC output by the ratio "100/new_bin"
		

	- splitfa : split fasta file in shorter segment on which the bootstraps will be made (one PSMC run for each segment)
		If you want to change the windows size (default = 500Kb) use the command as follow (example on 10Kb) : 
		"splitfa XXXX.psmcfa 10000 > XXX.consensus.psmcf"
		
Comments:
	!!!! USE :
	splitfa XXX.psmcfa (int segment size) > XXX.split.psmcfa
	only one ">" otherwie the file is way to large 
	!!!!

# STEP 2 : step2_bootstrap_psmc : 
	run psmc with '-b' option to do repetition in splitted fasta file
	- psmc : run psmc with chosen parameters 

# STEP 3 : step3_combined_plot_psmc : combine all psmc files and create file for plotting all repetition
	- combine all psmc from bootstraping in one file
	- psmc_plot.pl : perl script to get the Ne of the chosen iteration.

# output :
#----------#
PSMC output are as follow : 

File : consensus.psmcfa
